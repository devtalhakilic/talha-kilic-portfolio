                Hello everyone, my name is Talha Kılıç. I’ve been passionate about software and technology since I was 11 years old, and what started as a simple curiosity has now grown into a serious interest and skill set. In the early days, I experimented with small Python projects, writing basic scripts and exploring how coding works behind the scenes, which gave me a strong foundation in problem-solving and logic. Over time, I expanded my knowledge into web development, where I began learning how to create websites, work with modern frameworks, and understand the structure of the internet from a developer’s perspective. Recently, I’ve also started learning Java to broaden my programming skills and gain experience with more complex, object-oriented programming concepts. This journey has been a mix of curiosity, self-learning, and constant practice, and I’m excited to continue improving and building more advanced projects as I move forward.
            </p>
